# Markdown links 🔗

This project extracts links from Markdown files (with extensions: `.md`, `.mkd`, `.mdwn`, `.mdown`, `.mdtxt`,`.mdtext`, `.markdown`, `.text`) and checks their status.

## Who is it aimed to?

If you are interested in checking links from an old markdown file because you do not know if their still working or not, you could use this package to do it.

## Installation

🛠️ It is still in process.

## Features

When you type a path in your console as an argument, you can expect the following result:

* `href`: Link found.
* `text`: Link's text.
* `file`: Link's path.

If you add validation:

* `status`: Link's status.
* `statusText`: Descriptive link's status.

> Your path can be from a single file or a directory.

### How can you validate your links?

Typing in your console `true` after the path.
